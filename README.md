# Hashtagifier
NPM module that takes text and turns it into a hashtag.

This is really just an exercise in creating an NPM module.

# Set up
```bash
npm i hashtagifier
```

# Use
Takes a string, strips it of spaces and returns a hashtag.

```javascript
const hashtagifier = require('hashtagifier');

hashtagifier('blah blahblah');
// should return '#blahblahblah'
```
